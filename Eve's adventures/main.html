            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="introduction">
                <p>Hi, my name is Grace and this is my first static webpage featuring a java game project. <br>
                    The game is called "Eve's Adventures".<br>
                     I made this project during my first year of university using a library provided by the university.<br>
                    The game contains 3 levels each with a different story and is fully complete.<br>
                    Below is a video showing me playing the game. I hope you enjoy watching!</p>
            </div>

            <h2>How to play</h2>
            <h3> Controls</h3>
            <p>
                 Up arrow: Jump<br>Left arrow: Move left <br>Right arrow: Move right<br> [A] : Shoot lightning to the left<br>                          
                [D] : Shoot lightning to the right
            </p>
            
            <h3>Level 1</h3>
            <div class=" level1">
                <p>This is the easiest level! You must collect at least 4 apples while avoiding the snakes.<br>
                If the snakes touch you, you lose a life. 
            </p>
