            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="introduction">
                <p>Hi, my name is Grace and this is my first static webpage featuring a java game project. <br>
                    The game is called "Eve's Adventures".<br>
                     I made this project during my first year of university using a library provided by the university.<br>
                    The game contains 3 levels each with a different story and is fully complete.<br>
                    At the beginning of each level, the number of lives is initialised to 3.<br>
                    Below is a video showing me playing the game. I hope you enjoy watching!</p>
            </div>

            <h2>What's the context?</h2>
            <div id = "context">
                Level 1: This level is based on the biblical story of Adam and Eve.<br>
                The snake and the use of fruit hold much religious significance.<br>
