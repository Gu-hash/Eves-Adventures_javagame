                <p>Hi, my name is Grace and this is my first static webpage featuring a java project.<br>
                     I made this project during my first year of university using a library provided by the university.<br>
                    The game contains 3 levels each with a different story and is fully complete.<br>
                    Below is a video showing me playing the game. I hope you enjoy watching!</p>
