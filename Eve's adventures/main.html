                    <p>Hi, my name is Grace and this is my first static webpage featuring a java game project. <br>
                        The game is called "Eve's Adventures".<br>
                        I made this project during my first year of university using a library provided by the university.<br>
                        The game contains 3 levels each with a different story and is fully complete.<br>
                        At the beginning of each level, the number of lives is initialised to 3.<br>
                        Below is a video showing me playing the game. I hope you enjoy watching!</p>
